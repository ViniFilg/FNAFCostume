This repository serves as a crucial addition to my project, which revolves around creating a costume resembling the animatronics from the Five Nights At Freddy's game. To achieve this, I've incorporated a passive buzzer into the costume to play the game's iconic theme, "Les Toreadors." Additionally, I've included a set of LEDs to be placed in the costume's mouth, adding a unique visual element to the design
